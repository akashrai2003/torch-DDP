Explaination of variation:
Based on your benchmark results, I can see some significant performance variations. Here are the key factors explaining the training speed differences:

Main Performance Factors:
1. Communication Overhead
Single node, multiple processes: Fast communication via shared memory
Multi-node setups: Network communication between nodes adds latency
More processes across nodes: Increased synchronization overhead during gradient aggregation
2. Resource Contention
When running 2 processes on a single node:

Both processes compete for the same CPU cores, memory bandwidth, and I/O
Context switching between processes adds overhead
Memory bus saturation when both processes access data simultaneously
3. Batch Size Per Process
Your effective batch size changes with the number of processes:

More processes = smaller batch per process = more gradient updates
Smaller batches can lead to less efficient GPU/CPU utilization
May require more communication rounds for the same amount of data
4. Network Bottlenecks
Multi-node configurations suffer from:

SSH overhead for remote process startup
Network latency between vm-master, vm-worker1, and vm-worker2
Bandwidth limitations during all-reduce operations
Looking at Your Results Pattern:
The slower runs (570.06s, 302.09s) likely correspond to:

Multi-node configurations with communication overhead
Configurations where processes compete for resources
The faster runs (134.10s, 185.40s) are probably:

Single node, single process (no contention)
Optimal resource utilization scenarios
Recommendations:
# Add this to your benchmark script to capture configuration details
echo "Configuration: $nodes nodes, $procs processes per node" >> benchmark_results/config_log.txt
echo "Expected total processes: $((nodes * procs))" >> benchmark_results/config_log.txt

The key takeaway is that distributed training doesn't always mean faster training - it depends on the balance between parallelization benefits and communication/contention costs.
